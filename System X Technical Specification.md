 A Modular Dimensional Standard for Paper, Fabrication, and Digital Media

Document Version: 1.0    
Date: December 2025    
Status: Public Technical Specification

 Abstract

This document defines System X, a modular dimensional standard applicable to paper sheets, fabrication materials, and digital displays. System X establishes a family of ten precisely defined sizes (X0 through X9) derived through exact halving from a root dimension. All dimensions are expressed as integer millimetre values, with a strong preference for multiples of 5 mm. Unlike systems based on irrational aspect ratios, System X employs rational proportions that facilitate mental calculation, modular arithmetic, and straightforward implementation in both manual and automated workflows. This specification describes the system's dimensions, underlying principles, comparative context, and operational applications across printing, manufacturing, education, and digital environments.

 1\. Introduction and Design Philosophy

 1.1 Purpose and Scope

System X addresses the need for a dimensional standard that balances geometric regularity with practical usability. The system is designed to serve multiple domains: traditional paper manufacturing and printing, industrial material cutting, editorial and graphic design, educational mathematics, and pixel-based digital media. By constraining all dimensions to integer millimetres and favouring multiples of 5 mm, System X reduces computational overhead and simplifies tooling, measurement, and human verification.

This specification does not seek to replace existing standards but to provide an alternative framework where integer arithmetic, modular compatibility, and ease of mental calculation are prioritized.

 1.2 Historical Context

Dimensional standards for paper have existed for centuries, with varying degrees of mathematical rigour and practical convenience. The ISO 216 standard, introduced in 1975 and based on earlier German DIN specifications, employs an aspect ratio of 1:√2 to preserve proportions under halving. While geometrically elegant, this approach yields irrational dimensions that require rounding in practice, complicating mental arithmetic and introducing minor scaling inconsistencies across software implementations.

Other historical systems, such as traditional imperial sizes and North American letter formats, lack consistent halving properties and modular relationships, limiting their utility in scalable design workflows.

System X emerges from the recognition that a rational, integer-based system can provide sufficient modularity for practical applications while dramatically simplifying calculation, verification, and communication of dimensions.

 1.3 Design Goals

The primary design goals of System X are:

1\. Integer Millimetre Dimensions: All sizes are expressed as whole millimetre values, eliminating fractional arithmetic in specification and measurement.

2\. Exact Halving: Each size in the series is derived by halving the longer dimension of its predecessor, maintaining a clear geometric relationship across the family.

3\. Preference for Multiples of 5: Where possible, dimensions are chosen to be divisible by 5, simplifying division, mental estimation, and compatibility with common measurement increments.

4\. Rational Aspect Ratios: The system avoids dependence on irrational numbers, ensuring that aspect ratios can be expressed as simple fractions and calculated without floating-point arithmetic.

5\. Cross-Domain Applicability: The system is designed to function equally well in physical fabrication (paper, textiles, metal sheets) and digital environments (screens, images, layout software).

6\. Human Readability: Dimensions are chosen to be easily memorized, communicated verbally, and verified without electronic tools.

\---

 2\. Design Principles

 2.1 Exact Halving

The fundamental operation in System X is exact halving. Each successive size is generated by dividing the longer dimension of the previous size by two and maintaining the shorter dimension unchanged. This process is repeated iteratively from X0 to X9.

Mathematically, if a size Xn has dimensions W × H (width × height, in portrait orientation), then:

\- Xn+1 has dimensions (H/2) × W

This halving operation preserves the geometric relationship between sizes and ensures that two sheets of Xn+1 can be cut from one sheet of Xn with minimal waste, assuming guillotine cuts parallel to the sheet edges.

 2.2 Modular Arithmetic and Divisibility

System X dimensions are selected to maximize divisibility by small integers, particularly 2, 5, and 10\. This divisibility serves several purposes:

\- Simplified Division: Dividing dimensions by 2, 4, 5, or 10 yields clean integer results, simplifying grid calculations and layout subdivision.  
    
\- Modular Compatibility: Dimensions that share common factors facilitate the creation of modular systems where multiple sizes can be combined without introducing fractional offsets.

\- Manufacturing Tolerance: Integer dimensions aligned to 5 mm or 10 mm increments are easier to verify with standard measurement tools and align well with common manufacturing tolerances.

 2.3 Human and Machine Readability

System X prioritizes ease of communication and verification:

\- Mental Calculation: All dimensions are small enough to be easily manipulated mentally. For example, halving 960 mm yields 480 mm without calculator assistance.

\- Verbal Communication: Dimensions such as "six-eighty by nine-sixty" or "one-seventy by two-forty" are easily spoken and transcribed.

\- Software Implementation: Integer millimetre values map directly to integer pixel counts when screen resolution is defined (e.g., at 96 DPI, 240 mm \= 906 pixels; at 100 DPI, 240 mm \= 945 pixels). While not always yielding exact integers, the calculations remain straightforward.

\- Educational Value: The halving relationship and integer dimensions make System X suitable for teaching proportional reasoning, geometric series, and unit conversion.

 3\. System X Size Table

The following table defines the ten standard sizes of System X, designated X0 through X9. All dimensions are given in millimetres, in portrait orientation (width × height).

| Size | Width (mm) | Height (mm) | Aspect Ratio | Area (m²) |  
|----------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|  
| X0       | 2720           | 3840            | 1:1.412          | 10.4448       |  
| X1       | 1920           | 2720            | 1:1.417          | 5.2224        |  
| X2       | 1360           | 1920            | 1:1.412          | 2.6112        |  
| X3       | 960            | 1360            | 1:1.417          | 1.3056        |  
| X4       | 680            | 960             | 1:1.412          | 0.6528        |  
| X5       | 480            | 680             | 1:1.417          | 0.3264        |  
| X6       | 340            | 480             | 1:1.412          | 0.1632        |  
| X7       | 240            | 340             | 1:1.417          | 0.0816        |  
| X8       | 170            | 240             | 1:1.412          | 0.0408        |  
| X9       | 120            | 170             | 1:1.417          | 0.0204        |

 3.1 Dimensional Notes

Aspect Ratio: The aspect ratios alternate between approximately 1:1.412 and 1:1.417 due to rounding at each halving step. These values are close to but distinct from the ISO 216 aspect ratio of 1:√2 ≈ 1:1.414. The variation between 1.412 and 1.417 is within 0.4% and is operationally negligible for most applications.

Area Progression: Each size has approximately half the area of its predecessor. Minor deviations arise from rounding to integer millimetres.

Integer Dimensions: All width and height values are whole millimetres. The majority are multiples of 10 mm; several are multiples of 5 mm. This regularity simplifies measurement and reduces error in manual cutting.

 3.2 Orientation Convention

The table above presents sizes in portrait orientation (width \< height). In landscape orientation, the dimensions are simply transposed. For example:

\- X4 portrait: 680 mm × 960 mm  
\- X4 landscape: 960 mm × 680 mm

Software implementations should allow users to specify orientation explicitly or infer it from context.

 4\. Comparison with ISO 216 (A-series)

 4.1 ISO 216 Overview

The ISO 216 standard defines the A-series of paper sizes, with A0 as the root size having an area of 1 square metre and an aspect ratio of 1:√2. Successive sizes are derived by halving the longer dimension, preserving the aspect ratio exactly. A0 dimensions are 841 mm × 1189 mm.

The primary advantage of ISO 216 is the preservation of aspect ratio across all sizes, which ensures that scaled content maintains identical proportions. However, this benefit comes at the cost of irrational dimensions: 841 and 1189 are rounded approximations of √(10⁶) / √2 and √(2 × 10⁶).

 4.2 Dimensional Comparison

The table below compares selected System X sizes with their approximate ISO 216 equivalents:

| System X | Dimensions (mm) | Approx. ISO Equiv. | ISO Dimensions (mm) | Difference (%) |  
|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|  
| X0           | 2720 × 3840         | Between A0 and A1      | 841 × 1189 (A0)         | \+223% area         |  
| X2           | 1360 × 1920         | Between A1 and A2      | 594 × 841 (A1)          | \+123% area         |  
| X4           | 680 × 960           | Close to A2            | 420 × 594 (A2)          | \+156% area         |  
| X6           | 340 × 480           | Between A4 and A5      | 210 × 297 (A4)          | \+160% area         |  
| X8           | 170 × 240           | Close to A5            | 148 × 210 (A5)          | \+31% area          |

System X sizes do not align directly with ISO 216 sizes. X0 is substantially larger than A0, while X8 is slightly larger than A5. This misalignment reflects the different starting dimensions and rounding strategies of the two systems.

 4.3 Aspect Ratio Stability

ISO 216 maintains a constant aspect ratio of 1:√2 ≈ 1.414213562 across all sizes. System X aspect ratios alternate between approximately 1.412 and 1.417, a variation of approximately ±0.2% from the ISO value. This variation is a direct consequence of rounding to integer millimetres.

For applications requiring exact aspect ratio preservation (such as photographic enlargement without cropping), ISO 216 offers a theoretical advantage. However, practical implementations of ISO 216 often involve rounding at intermediate stages (especially in pixel-based environments), which can introduce similar minor distortions.

 4.4 Arithmetic Complexity

ISO 216 dimensions involve irrational numbers, requiring decimal approximations in all practical contexts. For example:

\- A4 dimensions (210 × 297\) appear simple but derive from 1000 / (2^(3/4) × √2) and 1000 / 2^(3/4).  
\- Halving an A4 sheet to create A5 yields 148.5 × 210, which is rounded to 148 × 210 in the standard, introducing a small proportional error.

System X dimensions are chosen explicitly and rounded at each step, avoiding the propagation of rounding errors across multiple halvings. All arithmetic involves integers, eliminating the need for floating-point calculations in layout software, CNC controllers, and manual worksheets.

 4.5 Practical Implications

For Printing: ISO 216 is deeply entrenched in the European paper industry, with established supply chains, cutting infrastructure, and software defaults. System X would require new tooling and supplier agreements.

For Digital Media: Screen resolutions and pixel grids are always discrete. System X dimensions, being explicit integers, may simplify pixel-perfect layout calculations. However, the aspect ratio variation between sizes requires designers to specify target size explicitly rather than relying on automatic scaling.

For Education: System X's integer dimensions and straightforward halving process make it easier to teach and understand without calculator dependence. ISO 216's irrational basis provides an elegant example of applied geometry but requires more abstract mathematical reasoning.

 5\. Use Cases

 5.1 Printing and Cutting

System X is directly applicable to the printing and cutting of paper, card stock, textiles, vinyl, and other sheet materials.

Guillotine Cutting: The exact halving property ensures that two sheets of Xn+1 can be cut from one sheet of Xn with a single straight cut, parallel to the shorter edge. This minimizes waste and simplifies cut planning.

Nested Layouts: Multiple smaller sheets can be arranged on a larger sheet in predictable patterns. For example, four X3 sheets fit exactly on one X1 sheet (two rows of two), and eight X4 sheets fit on one X2 sheet.

Print Production: Printers can optimize material usage by selecting the smallest System X size that accommodates the desired content plus margins. The integer dimensions simplify the configuration of print margins, bleed areas, and trim marks.

Material Stock: Manufacturers can standardize inventory around System X sizes, reducing SKU proliferation and simplifying reordering and storage.

 5.2 Editorial Grids and Graphic Design

System X dimensions provide a foundation for modular grid systems in print and digital design.

Column Grids: The divisibility of System X dimensions by 2, 5, and 10 facilitates the creation of column grids with clean gutter widths. For example:

\- An X4 sheet (680 × 960 mm) can be divided into 4 columns of 170 mm each with no gutters, or 4 columns of 160 mm with 10 mm gutters between columns and 10 mm margins on each side.  
\- An X5 sheet (480 × 680 mm) can accommodate 3 columns of 160 mm, 4 columns of 120 mm, or 6 columns of 80 mm, all with clean gutter calculations.

Baseline Grids: The preference for multiples of 5 mm aligns well with typographic baseline grids measured in points or millimetres. A 5 mm baseline grid (approximately 14.17 points) is a practical choice for body text and facilitates vertical rhythm.

Responsive Design: While System X is defined in absolute millimetres, designers can translate these dimensions to relative units (percentages, ems, rems) for responsive web design, maintaining the underlying proportional structure.

 5.3 Industrial Fabrication

System X extends beyond paper to any material supplied or processed in sheet form.

Metal and Plastic Sheets: Laser cutters, plasma cutters, and CNC routers benefit from predictable sheet sizes. Operators can program cutting paths using integer coordinates, avoiding floating-point rounding errors that may accumulate over multiple operations.

Textile Cutting: Fabric cutting tables often use metric measurements. System X dimensions align well with standard table widths (e.g., 1500 mm, 1800 mm) and facilitate efficient nesting of pattern pieces.

Modular Construction: Building panels, cladding, and partition systems can be designed around System X dimensions to ensure compatibility across manufacturers. For example, a modular wall system using X2 (1360 × 1920 mm) panels can subdivide into X3, X4, and X5 components for window frames, door inserts, and ventilation grilles.

Packaging: Box dimensions, label sizes, and insert sheets can be standardized to System X sizes, simplifying packaging line setup and reducing inventory complexity.

 5.4 Education and Manual Calculation

System X serves as an effective teaching tool in mathematics, design, and engineering education.

Proportional Reasoning: Students can explore halving sequences, geometric series, and ratio concepts using tangible, easily measured objects. The integer dimensions eliminate calculator dependence and allow students to focus on conceptual understanding.

Unit Conversion: Converting between millimetres, centimetres, metres, and (if desired) pixels or inches becomes straightforward when starting from clean integer values. For example, X7 (240 × 340 mm) \= (24 × 34 cm) \= (0.24 × 0.34 m).

Mental Arithmetic: Teachers can pose problems such as "How many X9 sheets fit on an X6 sheet?" (Answer: 8\) without requiring students to grapple with irrational square roots or complex decimal division.

Design Exercises: Art and design students can create layouts, collages, and compositions using physical System X sheets, developing an intuitive sense of modular design principles.

 5.5 Screens, Pixels, Software, and Images

System X dimensions translate effectively to digital environments, although they do not correspond to any established screen standard.

Pixel Mapping: When designing for screens, System X dimensions can be mapped to pixel counts based on a chosen resolution. For example, at 96 DPI (a common screen resolution):

\- X4 (680 × 960 mm) ≈ 2567 × 3622 pixels  
\- X6 (340 × 480 mm) ≈ 1283 × 1811 pixels  
\- X8 (170 × 240 mm) ≈ 642 × 906 pixels

These values are not exact integers but are sufficiently close for most applications. Designers can round to the nearest pixel or adopt a fractional pixel model if supported by the rendering engine.

Image Dimensions: Digital images (JPEG, PNG, TIFF) can be created at System X dimensions expressed in pixels. While these dimensions do not match common photographic aspect ratios (3:2, 4:3, 16:9), they provide a consistent framework for illustrations, diagrams, and documents intended for print via System X.

Software Defaults: Design software (Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Affinity Designer, Figma) can be configured with System X presets, allowing users to quickly create documents or artboards at standard sizes. The integer millimetre dimensions simplify the input of custom page sizes.

Responsive Web Design: Web designers can define breakpoints or container widths based on System X dimensions translated to CSS pixels. For example, a breakpoint at 680 CSS pixels might correspond to X4 width. While CSS pixels do not map directly to physical millimetres (due to varying screen densities), the proportional relationships remain useful.

Video and Animation: System X dimensions can serve as canvas sizes for motion graphics or animations, particularly when the output is intended for projection, print, or non-standard displays. The aspect ratios (approximately 1.41:1) are close to but distinct from common video ratios, requiring designers to compose deliberately rather than relying on automatic letterboxing or pillarboxing.

 6\. Advantages and Trade-offs

 6.1 Advantages

Integer Arithmetic: All dimensions are whole millimetres, eliminating fractional arithmetic in specification, measurement, and calculation. This reduces cognitive load and computational error.

Mental Calculation: Dimensions are small enough and sufficiently regular that designers, fabricators, and educators can perform halving, doubling, and subdivision operations mentally or with minimal tooling.

Predictable Nesting: The exact halving property ensures that smaller sheets nest cleanly into larger ones. Two Xn+1 sheets always fit precisely within one Xn sheet, minimizing cutting waste.

Divisibility: The preference for multiples of 5 mm and 10 mm facilitates division into equal parts, simplifying grid design, modular systems, and manufacturing tolerance specifications.

Cross-Domain Consistency: System X applies equally to paper, fabrication materials, and digital media. A single dimensional framework can span print, web, and industrial design workflows.

Educational Clarity: The system's simplicity makes it accessible to students and non-specialists. The absence of irrational numbers reduces abstraction and allows focus on geometric and proportional concepts.

Software Simplicity: Integer dimensions translate directly to integer coordinates in vector graphics, CNC G-code, and pixel-based layouts (with rounding where necessary). This reduces the risk of accumulating floating-point errors.

Communication Ease: Dimensions such as "680 by 960" are easy to speak, transcribe, and verify. There is no ambiguity or need for high-precision measurement tools.

 6.2 Trade-offs

Aspect Ratio Variation: System X aspect ratios alternate between approximately 1.412 and 1.417, a variation of ±0.2% from the mean. This variation is negligible for most applications but prevents exact aspect ratio preservation across all sizes. Content scaled from one System X size to another may require minor letterboxing or cropping.

Lack of Exact Aspect Ratio Constancy: Unlike ISO 216, where the 1:√2 ratio is theoretically preserved across all sizes, System X sacrifices this geometric purity in favour of integer dimensions. Applications requiring precise aspect ratio consistency (e.g., photographic enlargement) may find this limitation significant.

Non-Alignment with Established Standards: System X does not correspond to ISO 216, North American letter sizes, or any widely adopted standard. Adoption would require new infrastructure, supply agreements, and software presets. Existing equipment and workflows are optimized for other systems.

Larger Root Size: X0 (2720 × 3840 mm) is significantly larger than A0 (841 × 1189 mm), requiring larger cutting equipment and storage space. This may be impractical for some workshops and print facilities.

Limited Industry Adoption: As a newly defined system, System X has no established supply chain, manufacturing base, or regulatory recognition. Adoption would require coordination across manufacturers, designers, and standards bodies.

Aspect Ratio Unfamiliarity: The approximately 1.41:1 aspect ratio is close to but distinct from √2, 3:2, 4:3, and 16:9. Designers accustomed to these ratios may find System X proportions slightly unfamiliar, requiring adjustment in composition and layout habits.

 6.3 Suitability Assessment

System X is most suitable for:

\- New Design Contexts: Projects without legacy constraints, such as startup brands, independent publications, or experimental design studios.  
\- Educational Institutions: Schools and universities teaching design, mathematics, or engineering, where pedagogical clarity is prioritized.  
\- Custom Fabrication: Workshops and makerspaces with flexible cutting equipment, where integer dimensions simplify programming and reduce setup time.  
\- Digital-First Workflows: Web designers, app developers, and digital illustrators who work primarily in pixels and can define custom canvas sizes without friction.  
\- Modular Systems: Product designers, architects, and industrial engineers developing modular systems where compatibility and predictable nesting are critical.

System X is less suitable for:

\- Traditional Print Publishing: Industries deeply integrated with ISO 216 or North American standards, where changing paper sizes would disrupt existing supply chains and customer expectations.  
\- Photography: Applications requiring exact aspect ratio preservation for cropping and enlargement, where the √2 ratio offers a mathematical advantage.  
\- Regulatory Contexts: Environments where paper sizes are mandated by law or policy (e.g., government forms, legal documents).

 7\. Implementation Guidance

 7.1 Software Configuration

Designers and developers implementing System X should configure their tools as follows:

Vector Graphics Software (Illustrator, Inkscape):  
\- Define custom artboard presets for X0 through X9, specifying dimensions in millimetres.  
\- Set document units to millimetres.  
\- Enable snapping to grid with 5 mm or 10 mm increments.

Layout Software (InDesign, QuarkXPress):  
\- Create custom page size presets with System X dimensions.  
\- Define master pages for each size, including margin and column guides based on divisibility by 5 or 10\.  
\- Use baseline grids of 5 mm or multiples thereof.

Web Design (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD):  
\- Define frames or artboards with dimensions translated to pixels at a chosen DPI (e.g., 96 DPI, 72 DPI).  
\- Use CSS custom properties or variables to store System X dimensions in pixels or relative units.

CAD and CAM (AutoCAD, Fusion 360, CNC software):  
\- Set drawing units to millimetres.  
\- Define sheet templates for each System X size.  
\- Verify that all dimensions remain integers throughout the design and export process.

 7.2 Print Specifications

When specifying print jobs using System X:

\- State dimensions explicitly in millimetres (e.g., "X4, 680 × 960 mm, portrait").  
\- Specify orientation (portrait or landscape) to avoid ambiguity.  
\- Define margins, bleeds, and trim marks in millimetres, aligning to 1 mm or 5 mm increments where possible.  
\- Communicate with printers and paper suppliers in advance, as System X sizes may require custom cutting.

 7.3 Material Procurement

Manufacturers and workshops adopting System X should:

\- Source roll stock or large sheets (e.g., 3000 × 4000 mm) and cut to System X dimensions in-house.  
\- Establish relationships with suppliers willing to pre-cut materials to System X sizes.  
\- Maintain inventory of the most commonly used sizes (e.g., X4, X5, X6) while cutting larger sizes on demand.

 7.4 Tolerance and Rounding

In physical fabrication, tolerances are unavoidable. Recommended practices:

\- Cutting Tolerance: ±0.5 mm is a reasonable target for guillotine cutting; ±0.1 mm for CNC cutting.  
\- Measurement Verification: Use digital calipers or laser measurement tools to verify dimensions, especially for precision applications.  
\- Pixel Rounding: When converting to pixels, round to the nearest integer. Document the chosen DPI/PPI explicitly to ensure consistency across assets.

 7.5 Documentation and Communication

Teams adopting System X should:

\- Maintain a reference chart of System X dimensions in shared documentation.  
\- Label files and folders with size designations (e.g., "poster\_X2.pdf", "label\_X7.ai").  
\- Educate stakeholders (clients, collaborators, suppliers) about the system's principles and benefits.  
\- Provide printed reference cards or rulers marked with System X dimensions for field use.

 9\. Conclusion

System X offers a rational, integer-based alternative to established paper and dimensional standards. By prioritizing arithmetic simplicity, modular compatibility, and human readability, the system addresses practical needs in fabrication, design, education, and digital media. While it sacrifices the geometric elegance of constant aspect ratios, it gains in computational transparency and ease of use.

The system's suitability depends on context. For traditional print publishing deeply invested in ISO 216 infrastructure, migration to System X would involve significant cost and disruption. For new ventures, custom fabrication, digital-first workflows, and educational applications, System X presents a viable and potentially advantageous framework.

This specification provides the foundational dimensions and principles necessary for implementation. Further development may include:

\- Extended Sizes: Defining sizes beyond X9 (e.g., X10, X11) for business cards, stamps, and microform applications.  
\- Landscape Variants: Establishing naming conventions for landscape orientations (e.g., X4L for 960 × 680 mm).  
\- Derived Standards: Creating specifications for envelopes, folders, and binders dimensioned to fit System X sheets.  
\- Material Profiles: Documenting recommended paper weights, finishes, and substrates optimized for each System X size.  
\- Software Libraries: Developing plugins, scripts, and templates for popular design tools to streamline System X workflows.

System X is released as a contribution to the discourse on dimensional standards, offered in the spirit of openness and shared utility. Its ultimate value will be determined by its adoption, adaptation, and evolution within communities of practice.

 Appendix A: Dimensional Derivation

The following table illustrates the exact halving process used to generate System X dimensions:

| Step | Starting Size | Long Dimension | ÷ 2 | Rounded Result | New Size | New Dimensions |  
|----------|-------------------|--------------------|---------|--------------------|--------------|---------------------|  
| 0        | —                 | —                  | —       | —                  | X0           | 2720 × 3840         |

| 6        | X5                | 680                | 340     | 340                | X6           | 340 × 480           |  
| 7        | X6                | 480                | 240     | 240                | X7           | 240 × 340           |  
| 8        | X7                | 340                | 170     | 170                | X8           | 170 × 240           |  
| 9        | X8                | 240                | 120     | 120                | X9           | 120 × 170           |

All divisions yield exact integers, requiring no rounding. This exactness is a direct consequence of the careful selection of X0 dimensions.

 Appendix B: Aspect Ratio Analysis

The aspect ratios of System X sizes are as follows:

| Size | Aspect Ratio (decimal) | Aspect Ratio (fraction) | Difference from √2 |  
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|  
| X0       | 1.411764706                | 192/136 ≈ 96/68             | −0.17%                |  
| X1       | 1.416666667                | 68/48 \= 17/12               | \+0.18%                |  
| X2       | 1.411764706                | 96/68 \= 24/17               | −0.17%                |  
| X3       | 1.416666667                | 68/48 \= 17/12               | \+0.18%                |  
| X4       | 1.411764706                | 48/34 \= 24/17               | −0.17%                |  
| X5       | 1.416666667                | 34/24 \= 17/12               | \+0.18%                |  
| X6       | 1.411764706                | 24/17                       | −0.17%                |  
| X7       | 1.416666667                | 17/12                       | \+0.18%                |  
| X8       | 1.411764706                | 24/17                       | −0.17%                |  
| X9       | 1.416666667                | 17/12                       | \+0.18%                |

The aspect ratios alternate between two values: 24/17 ≈ 1.4118 and 17/12 ≈ 1.4167. Both are within 0.2% of √2 ≈ 1.4142. This minor variation is the trade-off for integer dimensions and is unlikely to be perceptible in practical applications.

 Appendix C: Pixel Conversions

The following table provides pixel dimensions for System X sizes at common screen resolutions:

| Size | Dimensions (mm) | 72 DPI (pixels) | 96 DPI (pixels) | 150 DPI (pixels) | 300 DPI (pixels) |  
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|  
| X0       | 2720 × 3840         | 7680 × 10842        | 10240 × 14456       | 16063 × 22677        | 32126 × 45354        |  
| X1       | 1920 × 2720         | 5421 × 7680         | 7228 × 10240        | 11339 × 16063        | 22677 × 32126        |  
| X2       | 1360 × 1920         | 3840 × 5421         | 5120 × 7228         | 8031 × 11339         | 16063 × 22677        |  
| X3       | 960 × 1360          | 2710 × 3840         | 3614 × 5120         | 5669 × 8031          | 11339 × 16063        |  
| X4       | 680 × 960           | 1920 × 2710         | 2560 × 3614         | 4016 × 5669          | 8031 × 11339         |  
| X5       | 480 × 680           | 1355 × 1920         | 1807 × 2560         | 2835 × 4016          | 5669 × 8031          |  
| X6       | 340 × 480           | 960 × 1355          | 1280 × 1807         | 2008 × 2835          | 4016 × 5669          |  
| X7       | 240 × 340           | 678 × 960           | 906 × 1280          | 1417 × 2008          | 2835 × 4016          |  
| X8       | 170 × 240           | 480 × 678           | 640 × 906           | 1004 × 1417          | 2008 × 2835          |

Conversion Formula:  
Pixels \= (mm × DPI) / 25.4

Note that pixel values are rounded to the nearest integer. For precise work, designers should specify the target DPI and verify pixel dimensions before finalizing assets.

Common Screen Resolutions:  
\- 72 DPI: Traditional Macintosh screen resolution (historical standard)  
\- 96 DPI: Standard Windows screen resolution; common default for web design  
\- 150 DPI: High-quality display; typical of modern tablets  
\- 300 DPI: Print-quality resolution; standard for offset printing and professional photography

For responsive web design, CSS pixels do not correspond directly to physical millimetres due to device pixel ratio variations. Designers should use System X dimensions as conceptual breakpoints rather than exact physical measurements.

\---

 Appendix D: Comparison with Common Standards

The following table compares System X with other dimensional standards:

| Standard | Root Size | Aspect Ratio | Halving Property | Integer Dimensions | Region |  
|--------------|---------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|  
| System X     | X0: 2720 × 3840 mm | \~1.41 (alternating) | Yes (exact) | Yes (all sizes) | Proposed |  
| ISO 216 (A-series) | A0: 841 × 1189 mm | 1:√2 (constant) | Yes (preserves ratio) | No (irrational) | International |  
| North American Letter | Letter: 215.9 × 279.4 mm | \~1.29 | No | No | USA, Canada, Mexico |  
| Japanese B-series (JIS) | B0: 1030 × 1456 mm | 1:√2 (constant) | Yes (preserves ratio) | No (irrational) | Japan |  
| Imperial (UK historical) | Various | Various | No | No (inches/fractions) | Historical UK |

Key Observations:

\- System X is unique in combining exact halving with integer dimensions across all sizes.  
\- ISO 216 achieves perfect aspect ratio preservation but requires irrational numbers.  
\- North American sizes lack geometric consistency and do not support efficient halving.  
\- Japanese B-series parallels ISO 216 but at a larger scale, maintaining the √2 aspect ratio.

\---

 Appendix E: Use Case Example – Editorial Grid

This example demonstrates how System X facilitates the design of a modular editorial grid for a magazine printed on X4 sheets (680 × 960 mm).

Page Specifications:  
\- Trim size: 680 × 960 mm (X4, portrait)  
\- Margins: 40 mm top, 60 mm bottom, 40 mm inside, 40 mm outside  
\- Text area: 600 × 860 mm  
\- Column count: 4  
\- Gutter width: 20 mm

Column Calculation:  
\- Total gutter width: 3 × 20 mm \= 60 mm  
\- Available width for columns: 600 mm − 60 mm \= 540 mm  
\- Column width: 540 mm ÷ 4 \= 135 mm

Baseline Grid:  
\- Line height: 5 mm (approximately 14.2 points at standard typesetting)  
\- Lines per column: 860 mm ÷ 5 mm \= 172 lines

Modular Units:  
The 135 mm column width is divisible by 5, facilitating further subdivision:  
\- 3 modules of 45 mm  
\- 5 modules of 27 mm  
\- 9 modules of 15 mm

Images, captions, and pull quotes can be sized to span 1, 2, 3, or 4 columns, with all dimensions resolving to clean multiples of 5 mm or 15 mm. This regularity simplifies template creation and ensures consistent visual rhythm.

Scalability:  
The same grid proportions can be applied to X3 (960 × 1360 mm) for posters or X5 (480 × 680 mm) for booklets, maintaining design consistency across formats.

 Appendix F: Material Waste Analysis

System X's exact halving property minimizes waste when cutting sheets. The following analysis compares material utilization for System X versus non-modular sizes.

Scenario 1: Cutting X5 sheets from X3 stock

\- X3 dimensions: 960 × 1360 mm  
\- X5 dimensions: 480 × 680 mm  
\- Expected yield: 4 sheets (2 rows × 2 columns)  
\- Calculation:  
  \- Width: 960 mm ÷ 480 mm \= 2 (exact)  
  \- Height: 1360 mm ÷ 680 mm \= 2 (exact)  
\- Waste: 0%

Scenario 2: Cutting X6 sheets from X4 stock

\- X4 dimensions: 680 × 960 mm  
\- X6 dimensions: 340 × 480 mm  
\- Expected yield: 4 sheets  
\- Calculation:  
  \- Width: 680 mm ÷ 340 mm \= 2 (exact)  
  \- Height: 960 mm ÷ 480 mm \= 2 (exact)  
\- Waste: 0%

Scenario 3: Cutting arbitrary size (200 × 300 mm) from X4 stock

\- X4 dimensions: 680 × 960 mm  
\- Target size: 200 × 300 mm  
\- Possible layouts:  
  \- Layout A: 3 sheets wide × 3 sheets tall \= 9 sheets (600 × 900 mm used)  
  \- Waste: 680 × 960 − 600 × 900 \= 652,800 − 540,000 \= 112,800 mm² (17.3% waste)

Conclusion:  
When cutting within the System X family, waste is eliminated. When cutting non-standard sizes, waste varies depending on dimensional compatibility. Designers should prioritize System X dimensions to maximize material efficiency.

 Appendix G: Frequently Asked Questions

Q1: Can System X be used for envelope sizes?

A: Yes. Envelopes can be designed to fit System X sheets with standard margins. For example:  
\- An envelope for X7 (240 × 340 mm) might measure 250 × 350 mm (adding 10 mm margin per side)  
\- An envelope for X9 (120 × 170 mm) might measure 130 × 180 mm

Custom envelope sizes would need to be sourced or manufactured, as they do not correspond to ISO 269 envelope standards.

Q2: How does System X handle bleed and trim?

A: Bleed (the area extending beyond the trim edge to ensure no white borders after cutting) is added to the document size. For example:  
\- X6 with 5 mm bleed on all sides: 350 × 490 mm document size, trimmed to 340 × 480 mm final size  
\- Software should be configured to show crop marks at the System X dimensions, with bleed extending beyond.

Q3: Is System X suitable for business cards?

A: X9 (120 × 170 mm) is larger than standard business cards (ISO 7810 ID-1: 85.6 × 53.98 mm; US: 88.9 × 50.8 mm). A hypothetical X10 size (85 × 120 mm) could be defined for business cards, though it would not align with existing standards. Alternatively, business cards could be designed as subdivisions of X9 with intentional waste.

Q4: Can System X dimensions be used in architectural drawings?

A: Yes. Architectural plans can be printed on System X sheets, and scale factors can be calculated based on integer dimensions. For example:  
\- 1:50 scale on X2 (1360 × 1920 mm) represents a 68 × 96 m area  
\- 1:100 scale on X1 (1920 × 2720 mm) represents a 192 × 272 m area

The integer dimensions simplify scale calculations compared to irrational ISO sizes.

Q5: What about compatibility with existing printing presses?

A: Most commercial printing presses are designed for ISO 216 or North American sizes. Printing on System X would require:  
\- Custom cutting of paper stock to System X dimensions before printing, or  
\- Printing on oversized sheets and trimming to System X after printing, or  
\- Using digital or wide-format printers capable of handling custom sizes

Small-scale or on-demand printing (laser, inkjet, digital offset) is more flexible and can accommodate System X with minimal adjustment.

Q6: How does System X handle double-page spreads?

A: A double-page spread in System X consists of two facing pages from the same size. For example:  
\- X5 spread: 960 × 680 mm (landscape, from two X5 portrait pages)  
\- X7 spread: 480 × 340 mm (landscape)

Spreads maintain the modular relationship: an X5 spread is equivalent to an X4 sheet in landscape orientation. This consistency simplifies layout planning for books and magazines.

Q7: Can System X be adapted for widescreen displays?

A: System X aspect ratios (\~1.41:1) do not match common widescreen ratios (16:9 \= 1.78:1, 16:10 \= 1.6:1). Content designed for System X will require letterboxing or cropping when displayed on widescreen monitors. However, System X can be used for portrait-oriented displays, tablet interfaces, or custom installations where aspect ratio is not constrained by consumer electronics standards.

Q8: What happens if I scale System X sizes by arbitrary percentages?

A: Scaling by arbitrary percentages will generally result in non-integer dimensions, negating one of System X's primary advantages. If scaling is necessary, designers should:  
\- Scale by factors that preserve integer results (e.g., 50%, 200%)  
\- Round to the nearest millimetre and document the rounding  
\- Consider whether the scaled size can be approximated by a different System X size

For best results, work within the defined System X sizes rather than scaling.

\---

 Appendix H: Historical Note on Integer-Based Systems

The use of integer dimensions in measurement systems has historical precedent. Traditional Chinese and Japanese paper sizes (such as the sun measurement system) employed integer multiples of basic units, facilitating mental calculation and handcraft. Medieval European paper sizes (such as foolscap, folio, quarto) were based on sheet folding but lacked the mathematical consistency of halving series.

The introduction of metric measurements in the 18th and 19th centuries allowed for greater precision but also enabled the use of irrational ratios (such as √2) for geometric elegance. System X can be seen as a synthesis: it adopts the metric system and modular halving principle of ISO 216 while returning to the integer simplicity of pre-industrial craft traditions.

This approach reflects a broader movement in design and engineering toward "human-scale" standards that balance mathematical sophistication with practical usability. Similar principles appear in modular building systems (e.g., Le Corbusier's Modulor), furniture standards, and grid-based urban planning.

 Closing Statement

System X represents a deliberate choice: to prioritize computational simplicity and human usability over geometric purity. It acknowledges that while irrational ratios have mathematical elegance, integer dimensions have practical power. In workshops, classrooms, and design studios where people calculate by hand, communicate verbally, and work with physical materials, the clarity of whole-number dimensions can be transformative.

This specification is offered as a tool, not a mandate. Its value will be proven through use, adaptation, and refinement by the communities that choose to adopt it. Whether System X becomes a widely recognized standard or remains a niche framework for specialized applications, its underlying principles—modularity, simplicity, and accessibility—represent enduring values in the design of dimensional systems.

The authors of this specification invite feedback, experimentation, and collaboration. System X is open for all to use, modify, and improve.
